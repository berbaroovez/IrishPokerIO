# Irish Poker IO

Irish poker is a drinking game that in which each player gets four cards dealt to them. They then take turns guessing the card before flipping it over. Each card has a different thing that needs to be guessed.

The Order is:

1. Black Or Red
2. Higher, Lower, or Same as the first card
3. Inside, Outside, or Same based on the first two cards
4. The suit

## Project Details

This is a socketio based project with a nextjs frontend and a node js backend. Both of which are written in typescript. The frontend is deployed on vercel while the backend is hosted on heroku.

I wanted to create this game because in quaratine there was no way to play this game online with friends and I thought it would be a interesting portoflio project.
